# Disclaimer
 **Nobody here is affiliated with Opera Norway, Opera Software, or Otello Corporation in any way, shape, or form.**
 
 *Please don't expect support from them for this extension*, and furthermore, don't get mad at them if the extension accidentally sends your grandma to Mars or something.
 
 Yell at the blue dog who made it instead! üê∫
 
# Credits & Attribution
 [Taylor](https://github.com/tayiorrobinson) for creating the first version of this. Formerly "GX Music", GXM used to be a lot simpler... then I got bored. üê∫
 
 [Ivan Stanton](https://opengameart.org/users/northivanastan) for the MIDI song "The Journey Continues".
 
 [Opera Norway](https://www.opera.com/gx) for creating a browser with lots of sounds. I like sounds.
 
 For the Common soundpack, the attributions are next to their related sound effects.
 
 town.mid is on like, every Windows computer. Are you using Windows? I bet you are...

# Privacy Policy
 **GXM does not collect any data.**
 
 Some things might be read, like the URL or the state of downloads, or browsing activity, but *all of that information is* ***NEVER*** *sent over the Internet*. It's only used internally, by the extension, so the music can react to events.
 
 **If you enable "Mute while shopping", [a list of shopping websites](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/corbindavenport/shop-list/list.txt) will be downloaded from jsdelivr.**
 
 If you don't want to ping jsdelivr, don't flip that toggle! ^^;

# Required Permissions
 üåê **Access your data for all websites**: Required so GXM can detect page events like mouse clicks and hovers to ramp up the music.
 
 *GXM won't read your cookies or anything like that.*
 
 üì• **Download files and read and modify the browser's download history**: Required so GXM can ramp up the music when downloads finish, if you so choose.
 
 *GXM won't download stuff or rewrite history. It only checks when downloads finish.*
 
 üîî **Display notifications to you**: Required to tell you when mods are installed, and what content has been added.
 
 *GXM won't notify you for anything other than that.*
 
 üìÇ **Access browser tabs**: Required to ramp up the music and play sound effects when tabs are opened and closed, plus disable the music in certain situations.
 
 *GXM will only care about the URL you're on if you have "Disable music while shopping" enabled. Even then, it's just used to mute the music.*
 
 ‚è≥ **Access browser activity during navigation**: Required to ramp up the music when pages load, if you so choose.
 
 *I don't know what kind of shady thing you could do with this permission, but whatever it is, GXM won't do it.*
 
 üíæ **Store unlimited amount of client-side data**: Required to store downloaded/created mods.
 
 *Without this permission, the extension would stop working after you download too many mods. I mean, it still can, but it's just highly unlikely now.*

# Installation
 Install it from the Firefox Addons Store! https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gx-mods/

 *Note: The strict minimum version for this extension is Firefox 57. You will most definitely have a degraded experience on a version this old. Notably, setting changes require a restart, and you can't make mods.*

 *The minimum version for full functionality is Firefox 95, but setting changes will still require a restart.*

# Usage

 **_Installing mods won't work properly in private windows!_** *You'll need to install mods and change your settings in a normal window first.*
 
 After that, it should be good to use in private windows, provided your browser doesn't start like that by default. Maybe I'll be able to fix this sometime in the future.



 By default, the extension comes with some default sound packs for you to play around with. Select one from the dropdown and the sounds will load in a second.
 
 If you want to play around with the browser sounds, [this page](https://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/ui/accessibility/unix/testcase/html/#Button_Test_Cases) is a pretty good place to start.
 
 When you start craving some more, you can make your own mods by opening the extension popup and scrolling to the bottom. There'll be a "Mods" button. Click that and you'll be good to go!
 
 Alternatively, you can *install real Opera GX mods* by heading to the [GX Store](https://store.gx.me/mods/). Most mods are supported, but you can't install wallpapers, shaders, or game strips. Wallpapers may come in a future update, not sure about the other two.

# Uninstalling the extension
 Warning you now! ***Before uninstalling/unloading the extension, please be sure to set all of your selected tracks to "None/No music"!*** Otherwise you will leak some memory.
 
 I would fix this myself, but Firefox doesn't offer a way to run a cleanup task before an extension fully unloads.. at least as far as I can tell.
 
 *Setting the tracks to "None/No music" allows the extension to fully clean itself up.* The Enabled switch just mutes the music, so don't be fooled by that either.
